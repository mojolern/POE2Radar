# POE2Radar

An external map/radar overlay for Path of Exile 2 with built-in mods, a web dashboard, and full customization.

Attaches to the PoE2 client, reads game state out of process memory (no injection, no hooks), draws a terrain + entity overlay, and optionally patches game constants for quality-of-life tweaks.

> **Use at your own risk.** This reads another process's memory, patches game instructions, and can send keystrokes. This may violate Path of Exile's Terms of Service and could put your account at risk. Educational purposes only.

## Features

### Radar Overlay
- **Terrain map** — walkable grid rendered as a bitmap on the in-game map
- **Entity dots** — monsters, NPCs, chests, transitions, other players, POIs
- **Rarity shapes** — Normal (circle), Magic (diamond), Rare (triangle), Unique (star)
- **HP nameplates** — world-space health bars over Magic/Rare/Unique monsters
- **Tile landmarks** — static features from terrain data (boss arenas, treasure, waypoints) shown immediately on area entry
- **Custom landmarks** — community-contributed tile labels with boss names, rewards, and directions (embedded JSON, 450+ entries across all acts)
- **Watched entity labels** — add any entity to a watchlist with a custom nickname that renders on the overlay

### Cheats (Byte Patching)
All cheats use AOB pattern scanning + `WriteProcessMemory`. Original bytes are saved and restored on exit.

| Hotkey | Cheat | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| F1 | No Atlas Fog | Removes fog of war from the atlas |
| F2 | Reveal Map | Reveals the full minimap |
| F3 | Infinite Zoom | Removes the zoom clamp (zoom out further) |
| F4 | Enemy HP Bars | Forces all enemy health bars visible |
| F5 | Player Light | Adjustable light radius (slider, default 2000, up to 50000) |

### Web Dashboard (`http://localhost:7777` or F11)
A full browser-based control panel served on localhost.

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Live Entities** | Real-time list of every entity in your zone. Filter by category, search by metadata path, toggle alive-only. Click "Watch" to add to watchlist with a custom nickname. |
| **Watched List** | All watched entity patterns with nicknames. Add custom patterns, remove entries. **Import/Export JSON** to share watchlists with others. Persists to `config/watched_entities.json`. |
| **Entity Database** | 6,692 entity paths extracted from the GGPK. Search, filter by category (Monsters, Chests, NPC, etc.), and add to watchlist directly. |
| **Radar Settings** | Full visual customization with no artificial limits. Includes: visibility toggles, dot sizes, outline width/color, font sizes (up to 72 for 4K), all entity colors, terrain opacity, map calibration, flask thresholds. Saves to `config/radar_settings.json`. |
| **Landmarks** | Browse all terrain tile landmarks in the current zone with paths and distances. |

### Auto-Flask
- Sends flask keystrokes when HP or Mana drops below configurable thresholds
- Foreground-gated (only when PoE2 is focused), per-flask cooldowns
- F8 master kill-switch
- Thresholds adjustable via web dashboard

### Anti-Detection
- Executable launches as a random-named hardlink (e.g. `Tocufe.exe`)
- Overlay window class and title are randomized
- No "POE2Radar" strings in the binary
- Character name hidden from overlay and API
- No branding in any visible UI element

### Watchlist Sharing
- **Export** your watched entities as a JSON file from the web dashboard
- **Import** a JSON file to merge entries into your watchlist
- Share watchlists with friends — they import and get all your nicknames + patterns instantly

### Settings Persistence
All configuration saves to the `config/` directory next to the executable:
- `radar_settings.json` — all visual/radar settings (colors, sizes, fonts, visibility, calibration, flask thresholds)
- `watched_entities.json` — entity watchlist with nicknames

Everything auto-loads on startup and auto-saves on change.
